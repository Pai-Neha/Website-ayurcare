            <p>
                Fever is a temporary rise in body temperature. It is usually caused by an infection. The symptoms of fever can include sweating, chills and shivering, headache, muscle aches, loss of appetite, irritability, dehydration, and general weakness. A fever is usually considered to be a temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that’s 100 F (37.8 C) or higher. Depending on what’s causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include: Sweating, Chills and shivering, Headache, Muscle aches, Loss of appetite, Irritability. Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don’t necessarily need to treat a fever if it’s not causing discomfort. If you notice that the fever has lasted for longer than 2-3 days or an infant has fever or fever of 103 F or higher in adults or other mild to moderate symptoms then see a doctor immediately if you notice feelings of disorientation or confusion, a rash has appeared and is spreading, chest pain or breathing difficulties, continuous vomiting.
