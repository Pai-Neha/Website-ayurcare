            <p>
                Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. It can lead to serious health issues, including heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems. Symptoms of hypertension may not be noticeable, which is why regular blood pressure monitoring is crucial. Management includes lifestyle changes such as dietary modifications, exercise, and medication as prescribed by a healthcare provider. It's essential to manage hypertension to reduce the risk of complications.
