            <h1>Additional Information</h1>
            <p>
                Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects the airways in the lungs, causing them to narrow and become inflamed. While it can be managed effectively, it's essential for individuals with asthma to follow their healthcare provider's guidance closely. Proper management, including the use of controller and rescue medications, avoidance of triggers, and lifestyle adjustments, can help individuals lead a healthy life with asthma. Awareness and education about asthma are crucial for both individuals with asthma and their caregivers.
