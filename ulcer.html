                <p>
                    An ulcer is a sore or lesion that forms on the skin or mucous membranes, commonly occurring in the stomach or small intestine. Gastric ulcers in the stomach and duodenal ulcers in the small intestine are the most common types. Ulcers can be caused by various factors, including the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and excessive stomach acid production. Symptoms may include burning stomach pain, bloating, heartburn, and nausea.

                    While some ulcers may resolve with over-the-counter antacids or lifestyle changes, it's important to consult a healthcare provider if you suspect an ulcer or experience persistent or severe symptoms. Untreated ulcers can lead to complications, including bleeding or perforation of the stomach or intestine. A healthcare provider can diagnose the condition and provide appropriate treatment.
