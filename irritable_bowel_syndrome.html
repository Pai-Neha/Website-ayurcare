                    Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common digestive disorder that affects the large intestine (colon). It is characterized by symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, gas, and changes in bowel habits, including diarrhea, constipation, or both. IBS is a chronic condition that can impact a person's quality of life. The exact cause of IBS is not well understood, but it may involve a combination of factors, including diet, stress, and changes in gut motility.

                    While IBS is typically a non-life-threatening condition, it can significantly impact one's quality of life. If you experience severe or persistent symptoms, or if you notice unusual changes in your bowel habits, it's important to consult a healthcare provider. IBS is diagnosed based on specific criteria and after ruling out other potential causes. Professional guidance can help you manage your symptoms effectively.
