            <h1>Additional Information</h1>
            <p>
                Anemia is a medical condition that can result from various factors, including dietary deficiencies, chronic diseases, and genetic factors. It's characterized by a decreased number of red blood cells or a decrease in the quality or quantity of hemoglobin in the blood. Anemia can lead to a range of symptoms, from fatigue and weakness to shortness of breath and pale skin. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential to manage anemia effectively and improve overall health and quality of life.
