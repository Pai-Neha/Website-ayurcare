                <p>
                    Acid reflux, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is a digestive condition that occurs when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing symptoms like heartburn and regurgitation. It can be a chronic condition and may lead to complications if left untreated. Common triggers for acid reflux include spicy or fatty foods, large meals, obesity, and certain medical conditions.

                <p>
                    While mild acid reflux can often be managed with dietary and lifestyle changes, persistent or severe symptoms may require medical attention. If you experience symptoms like difficulty swallowing, chest pain, or if acid reflux affects your daily life, it's essential to consult a healthcare provider. Untreated acid reflux can lead to complications, including esophageal damage.
