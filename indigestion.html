                    Indigestion, also known as dyspepsia, is a common digestive issue that can cause discomfort or pain in the upper abdomen. It is often associated with symptoms like bloating, burping, and a feeling of fullness after eating. Indigestion can be caused by various factors, including overeating, consuming spicy or fatty foods, stress, or underlying medical conditions.

                    While occasional indigestion can often be managed with dietary and lifestyle changes, persistent or severe symptoms may require medical attention. If you experience indigestion along with alarming signs such as unintentional weight loss, difficulty swallowing, blood in vomit or stool, or persistent vomiting, it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for a comprehensive evaluation and appropriate treatment.
